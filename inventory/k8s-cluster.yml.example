# Kubernetes Cluster Inventory - Example Template
#
# NOTE: This file is AUTO-GENERATED by the vagrant-vm role during VM creation.
#       You typically don't need to create this manually.
#
# The vagrant-vm role will create inventory/k8s-cluster.yml with the actual
# IP addresses assigned to your VMs during creation.
#
# If you need to create this manually, use the structure below and update
# the ansible_host IPs to match your VMs.
